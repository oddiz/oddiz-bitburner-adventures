    /* To understand what is done below we need to do some math. I hope the explanation is clear enough.
     * First of, the names will be shortened for ease of manipulation:
     * n:= targetMoney (n for new), o:= startMoney (o for old), b:= exponentialBase, t:= threadMultiplier, c:= cycles/threads
     * c is what we are trying to compute.
     *
     * After growing, the money on a server is n = (o + c) * b^(c*t)
     * c appears in an exponent and outside it, this is usually solved using the productLog/lambert's W special function
     * this function will be noted W in the following
     * The idea behind lambert's W function is W(x)*exp(W(x)) = x, or in other words, solving for y, y*exp(y) = x, as a function of x
     * This function is provided in some advanced math library but we will compute it ourself here.
     *
     * Let's get back to solving the equation. It cannot be rewrote using W immediately because the base of the exponentiation is b
     * b^(c*t) = exp(ln(b)*c*t) (this is how a^b is defined on reals, it matches the definition on integers)
     * so n = (o + c) * exp(ln(b)*c*t) , W still cannot be used directly. We want to eliminate the other terms in 'o + c' and 'ln(b)*c*t'.
     *
     * A change of variable will do. The idea is to add an equation introducing a new variable (w here) in the form c = f(w) (for some f)
     * With this equation we will eliminate all references to c, then solve for w and plug the result in the new equation to get c.
     * The change of variable performed here should get rid of the unwanted terms mentionned above, c = w/(ln(b)*t) - o should help.
     * This change of variable is allowed because whatever the value of c is, there is a value of w such that this equation holds:
     * w = (c + o)*ln(b)*t  (see how we used the terms we wanted to eliminate in order to build this variable change)
     *
     * We get n = (o + w/(ln(b)*t) - o) * exp(ln(b)*(w/(ln(b)*t) - o)*t) [ = w/(ln(b)*t) * exp(w - ln(b)*o*t) ]
     * The change of variable exposed exp(w - o*ln(b)*t), we can rewrite that with exp(a - b) = exp(a)/exp(b) to isolate 'w*exp(w)'
     * n = w/(ln(b)*t) * exp(w)/exp(ln(b)*o*t) [ = w*exp(w) / (ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) ]
     * Almost there, we just need to cancel the denominator on the right side of the equation:
     * n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t) = w*exp(w), Thus w = W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t))
     * Finally we invert the variable change: c = W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t))/(ln(b)*t) - o
     *
     * There is still an issue left: b^(o*t) doesn't fit inside a double precision float
     * because the typical amount of money on servers is arround 10^6~10^9
     * We need to get an approximation of W without computing the power when o is huge
     * Thankfully an approximation giving ~30% error uses log immediately so we will use
     * W(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) ~= log(n * ln(b) * t * b^(o*t)) = log(n * ln(b) * t) + log(exp(ln(b) * o * t))
     * = log(n * ln(b) * t) + ln(b) * o * t

     * The Newton-Raphson method will be used, this method is a classic to find roots of functions
     * (given f, find c such that f(c) = 0).
     *
     * The idea of this method is to take the horizontal position at which the horizontal axis
     * intersects with of the tangent of the function's curve as the next approximation.
     * It is equivalent to treating the curve as a line (it is called a first order approximation)
     * If the current approximation is c then the new approximated value is c - f(c)/f'(c)
     * (where f' is the derivative of f).
     *
     * In our case f(c) = (o + c) * b^(c*t) - n, f'(c) = d((o + c) * b^(c*t) - n)/dc
     * = (ln(b)*t * (c + o) + 1) * b^(c*t)
     * And the update step is c[new] = c[old] - ((o + c) * b^(c*t) - n)/((ln(b)*t * (o + c) + 1) * b^(c*t))
     *
     * The main question to ask when using this method is "does it converges?"
     * (are the approximations getting better?), if it does then it does quickly.
     * DOES IT CONVERGES? In the present case it does. The reason why doesn't help explaining the algorithm.
